* Overview
  
  A database agnostic version control framework with deterministic state detection.

** How does it work?

   ~./revisions~ directory.  Files are sorted by a timestamp

*** Immutable update files

    The contents of an update file should be hashed and (manually) saved.  When doing a rollback,
    the hash can be compared to verify that the update file is indeed the same as when the update
    was executed.


*** The database context
    
    To remain completely agnostic, the database connection should be defined in the initial
    configuration and passed to each method as the the context.  There will be no assumptions about
    the database and no API for interacting with database objects.


*** Detect version

*** Database table design
